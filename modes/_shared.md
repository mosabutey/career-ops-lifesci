# System Context -- career-ops

<!-- ============================================================
     THIS FILE IS AUTO-UPDATABLE. Do not put personal data here.

     User-specific strategy belongs in modes/_profile.md and
     config/profile.yml.
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` | ALWAYS if present |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS |
| _profile.md | `modes/_profile.md` | ALWAYS after this file |

**RULE:** Never hardcode metrics. Read them from `cv.md` and `article-digest.md` at evaluation time.
**RULE:** `article-digest.md` takes precedence over `cv.md` for detailed proof-point language.
**RULE:** Read `modes/_profile.md` after this file. User overrides always win.

## Operating Model

Career-ops now reasons on two axes:

1. `role_pack` -- what kind of employer or function the opportunity belongs to
2. `career_stage` -- where the candidate is in their career journey

### Role packs

| Role pack | Typical roles | What employers buy |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| `biopharma_medical` | MSL, medical affairs, clinical scientist, scientific affairs, translational science | Scientific credibility, evidence interpretation, external communication, therapeutic fluency |
| `life_sciences_consulting` | Strategy, diligence, advisory, portfolio, market-facing consulting | Structured thinking, synthesis, executive communication, commercial judgment |
| `healthtech_scientific` | Product, clinical strategy, medical content, partnerships, solutions | Workflow empathy, evidence-to-product translation, stakeholder communication |
| `adjacent_generalist` | Strategy, ops, program, chief of staff, generalist transition roles | Leadership, ambiguity navigation, cross-functional execution |

### Career stages

| Career stage | Typical candidates | What to emphasize |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| `student_early` | undergraduate, graduate student, internship, externship, co-op, trainee | initiative, learning velocity, ownership, readiness to enter industry |
| `advanced_training` | PhD candidate, postdoc, MD-PhD, resident, fellow, research trainee | rigor, maturity, transferability, stakeholder range, depth plus adaptability |
| `experienced_professional` | clinician, scientist, consultant, operator, manager | leverage, leadership, repeated delivery, applied judgment |

### Detection rules

Before evaluating any opportunity:
1. Detect the primary `role_pack`.
2. Detect the candidate's `career_stage` from `config/profile.yml`.
3. If the role is hybrid, name the primary pack and the closest secondary pack.
4. Adapt scoring, framing, outreach, and document strategy using both.

Use the language of the JD and the user's profile, but keep canonical repo terminology in English.

## Scoring System

Use a common base rubric plus pack-aware and stage-aware overlays.

### Base rubric

| Dimension | What it measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Role fit | Alignment between the JD and proven strengths |
| Level fit | Match between required level and the candidate's plausible level |
| Domain relevance | Therapeutic, scientific, clinical, product, or business relevance |
| Evidence strength | How strong the candidate's proof points are for this role |
| Stakeholder readiness | Communication range for the humans this role serves |
| Transition feasibility | How realistic the move is right now |
| Compensation and logistics | Market pay, location, travel, visa, work model |
| Application return-on-time | Whether this is a strong use of the candidate's time |

When sponsorship or work authorization is relevant:
- explicit employer restrictions matter
- silence does not automatically mean rejection
- candidate answers must distinguish between work authorization now and sponsorship later
- if `authorization.candidate_profile_type` exists, use it to interpret the candidate's truthful answer pattern rather than improvising from scratch

### Stage overlay

- `student_early`: emphasize learning curve, signal value, coachability, and entry plausibility.
- `advanced_training`: emphasize transferability, maturity, rigor, and narrative conversion.
- `experienced_professional`: emphasize scope, leverage, direct applicability, and leadership.

### Role-pack overlay

- `biopharma_medical`: prioritize scientific credibility, evidence interpretation, therapeutic fit, clinician-facing or expert-facing readiness.
- `life_sciences_consulting`: prioritize problem structuring, synthesis, executive communication, client readiness, and commercial curiosity.
- `healthtech_scientific`: prioritize workflow understanding, evidence-to-product translation, stakeholder empathy, and cross-functional execution.
- `adjacent_generalist`: prioritize operating range, ambiguity handling, leadership, and reusable pattern recognition.

### Score interpretation

- 4.5+ -> Strong match, recommend applying now
- 4.0-4.4 -> Good match, worth applying
- 3.5-3.9 -> Stretch or situational apply
- Below 3.5 -> Recommend against applying unless the user has a specific reason

## Report Requirements

Every evaluation report must include the following header fields:

```markdown
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Track:** {primary role pack}
**Career Stage:** {career stage}
**Score:** X/5
**URL:** {job URL or local reference}
**PDF:** {path or pending}
```

Every report must explain:
- Why this role fits or does not fit
- How the candidate's experience maps into employer language
- What language to use in the resume, outreach, or interview
- What could worry the employer
- How to close the gaps honestly

**RULE:** Include `**URL:**` in every report header, even for local or manually saved JDs.

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience, metrics, titles, publications, or responsibilities
2. Modify `cv.md` or portfolio files without the user's explicit request
3. Submit applications on the candidate's behalf
4. Share phone numbers in generated outreach
5. Recommend low-fit spray-and-pray applications
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use vague corporate filler when a specific phrase would be clearer
8. Ignore the tracker after evaluating a role

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** if the form allows one, include one. Keep the same visual design as the resume, map JD language to real proof points, and keep it to one page maximum.
1. Read `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, and `article-digest.md` if present before evaluating.
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** run `node cv-sync-check.mjs`. If it returns warnings, notify the user before continuing.
2. Detect role pack and career stage before scoring.
3. Cite exact CV evidence when mapping fit.
4. Use WebSearch for compensation and company context.
5. Register new evaluations through `batch/tracker-additions/`. Never add new tracker entries directly to `data/applications.md`.
6. Update existing tracker rows directly only when changing status, PDF state, or notes.
7. Generate output in the JD language when appropriate; English is the default.
8. Keep language direct, concrete, and easy to trust.
9. Include `**URL:**` in every report header.
10. Treat internships, externships, co-ops, fellowships, and trainee roles as first-class paths, not edge cases.
11. Use concise, native professional English in generated materials unless the JD language requires otherwise. Prefer short sentences, action verbs, and specific evidence over filler.

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| WebSearch | Compensation research, company context, contact discovery, fallback JD discovery |
| WebFetch | Fallback for static job pages or public structured pages |
| Playwright | Job verification and dynamic page reading. Never run multiple Playwright-heavy scans in unsafe parallel patterns. |
| Read | `cv.md`, `article-digest.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `templates/cv-template.html` |
| Write | Reports, temporary HTML for PDFs, cover letters when needed, and tracker TSV additions |
| Edit | Existing tracker rows only. Do not use `Edit` to create new tracker entries. |
| Canva MCP | Optional visual CV workflow when `canva_resume_design_id` exists |
| Bash / Node | `generate-pdf.mjs`, `cv-sync-check.mjs`, integrity scripts, update checks |

### Time-to-opportunity priority

- Clear evidence and strong positioning > exhaustive perfection
- Apply sooner to high-fit roles > overthinking mediocre roles
- Honest narrative conversion > inflated reinvention
- Career durability > short-term vanity fit

## Professional Writing and ATS Compatibility

These rules apply to all candidate-facing documents: resumes, cover letters, form answers, networking messages, and summaries.

### Avoid empty phrases

- "passionate about"
- "results-oriented"
- "proven track record"
- "innovative"
- "synergy"
- "best practices" without naming the actual practice

### Prefer conversion language

- Name the audience: clinicians, scientists, operators, product teams, executives, investors, students
- Name the work: designed protocol, led analysis, taught course section, improved process, synthesized evidence
- Name the result: reduced wait time, secured funding, improved throughput, clarified decision, enabled launch

### ATS rules

- Single-column layout
- Standard headers
- Selectable text, not rasterized text
- No critical information in headers or footers
- No invented keywords; only rephrase real experience using relevant employer language

### Sentence style

- Keep sentences short and specific
- Vary sentence openings
- Favor verbs and outcomes over adjectives
