# Mode: apply -- Live Application Assistant

Interactive mode for when the candidate is filling out a job application form in Chrome. Read what is on screen, load the prior context for the role, and generate tailored answers for every visible question.

This mode can be used for browser-assisted application work on the candidate's local machine. The system may open job pages, inspect forms, upload the correct resume or cover letter file, and fill fields for review, but the candidate remains the final reviewer and submitter.

## Requirements

- **Best with visible Playwright**: in visible mode, the candidate can see the browser and the agent can interact with the page.
- **Without Playwright**: the candidate shares a screenshot or pastes the questions manually.
- **File uploads**: if the candidate wants the agent to upload a resume or cover letter, the file path must be known and the intended document should be confirmed first.

## Workflow

```
1. DETECT    -> Read the active Chrome tab (screenshot/URL/title)
2. IDENTIFY  -> Extract company + role from the page
3. SEARCH    -> Match against existing reports in reports/
4. LOAD      -> Read the full report + Section H (if present)
5. COMPARE   -> Does the on-screen role match the evaluated one? If it changed, warn
6. ANALYZE   -> Identify ALL visible form questions
7. GENERATE  -> Generate a personalized answer for each question
8. PRESENT   -> Show copy-paste-ready responses
```

## Step 1 -- Detect the role

**With Playwright:** take a snapshot of the active page. Read the title, URL, and visible content.

If the candidate asks for it and browser control is available, the agent may:
- navigate to the company job page
- open the application flow
- inspect visible fields and upload controls
- prepare the browser state for the candidate's review

**Without Playwright:** ask the candidate to:
- Share a screenshot of the form
- Paste the form questions as text
- Or provide the company + role so the context can be loaded

## Step 2 -- Identify and load context

1. Extract the company name and role title from the page
2. Search `reports/` by company name
3. If there is a match -> load the full report
4. If Section H exists -> use the previous draft answers as a starting point
5. If there is no match -> say so and offer a quick auto-pipeline evaluation
6. Read `config/profile.yml` for `authorization` details before answering work authorization or sponsorship questions

## Step 3 -- Detect role changes

If the role on screen differs from the evaluated role:
- **Warn the candidate**: "The role changed from [X] to [Y]. Do you want me to re-evaluate it or adapt the answers to the new title?"
- **If adapting**: adjust the answers to the new title without re-running the full evaluation
- **If re-evaluating**: run a full A-G evaluation, update the report, and regenerate Section H
- **Update the tracker**: change the role title in `applications.md` if needed

## Step 4 -- Analyze form questions

Identify ALL visible questions:
- Free-text fields (cover letter, why this role, etc.)
- Dropdowns (how did you hear about us, work authorization, etc.)
- Yes/No questions (relocation, visa, etc.)
- Salary fields (range, expectation)
- Upload fields (resume, cover letter PDF)
- Attachments and document selectors (resume variant, transcript, writing sample, supporting files)

Classify each question:
- **Already answered in Section H** -> adapt the existing answer
- **New question** -> generate a new answer from the report + `cv.md`

## Step 5 -- Generate responses

For each question, generate the response using:

1. **Report context**: proof points from Block B, STAR stories from Block G
2. **Previous Section H**: if a draft answer already exists, refine it instead of starting from scratch
3. **"I'm choosing you" tone**: same framework as auto-pipeline
4. **Specificity**: reference something concrete from the JD visible on screen
5. **career-ops proof point**: include it in "Additional info" if relevant
6. **Authorization truthfulness**: use `authorization` from `config/profile.yml` when present and never overstate work eligibility

For work authorization and sponsorship questions:
- answer truthfully based on the candidate profile
- distinguish between `authorized to work now` and `will require sponsorship in the future`
- if a form collapses both concepts into a single yes/no question, explain the tradeoff in notes if needed
- if the form text conflicts with the candidate's actual situation, tell the candidate before suggesting a response
- never tell the candidate to answer `no` to future sponsorship if the profile says future sponsorship will be required
- if the company explicitly states no sponsorship and the candidate does require it, flag the mismatch clearly before continuing

For uploads and form-filling:
- choose the document variant that best matches the evaluated role
- confirm the intended file before upload when multiple variants exist
- upload only files the candidate has approved or that were generated for this role
- fill visible fields carefully and re-check values
- do not invent required information the candidate has not approved
- stop before the final submit or send action so the candidate can review everything

**Output format:**

```
## Answers for [Company] -- [Role]

Based on: Report #NNN | Score: X.X/5 | Track: [role pack] | Career Stage: [stage]

---

### 1. [Exact form question]
> [Copy-paste-ready answer]

### 2. [Next question]
> [Answer]

...

---

Notes:
- [Any note about role changes, mismatches, etc.]
- [Any personalization suggestion the candidate should review]
- [Any sponsorship or work authorization clarification the candidate should double-check]
```

## Step 6 -- Post-apply (optional)

If the candidate confirms that the application was submitted:
1. Update the status in `applications.md` from `Evaluated` to `Applied`
2. Update Section H in the report with the final answers
3. Suggest the next step: `/career-ops contact` for LinkedIn outreach

## Safety boundary

- The agent may help open sites, upload files, and fill sections.
- The candidate must review the application before submission.
- Do not click the final submit action unless the candidate explicitly asks for a final handoff and still has a chance to review first.

## Scroll handling

If the form has more questions than are visible:
- Ask the candidate to scroll and share another screenshot
- Or paste the remaining questions
- Process in iterations until the full form is covered
