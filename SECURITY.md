# Security and Privacy

Career-Ops LifeSci is a local-first system. The primary security goal is simple:

- keep personal data local
- keep public repo content generic
- keep browser-assisted workflows inside explicit human-review boundaries

This document explains the expected security posture for contributors and local users.

## Threat Model

The main risks in this repo are not classic server-side exploits. They are:

- accidental publication of private candidate data
- accidental publication of browser/session artifacts
- accidental publication of credentials or test-account secrets
- unsafe assumptions about what an ATS flow actually did
- generated documents fetching remote assets during local rendering

This repo is designed to reduce those risks, not to bypass platform security controls.

## Public Repo Rules

Never commit:

- `cv.md`
- `config/profile.yml`
- `modes/_profile.md`
- `article-digest.md`
- `portals.yml`
- `data/*`
- `reports/*`
- `output/*`
- `jds/*`
- `.env` or `.env.*`
- browser auth/session exports such as `playwright/.auth/` or `storage-state*.json`
- captured network archives such as `*.har`

If a file contains real identity, contact, compensation, authorization, disclosure, account, or application data, it belongs in the local user layer only.

## Browser Automation Boundaries

Agents should not:

- bypass captchas or anti-bot systems
- harvest or exfiltrate cookies, tokens, or session data
- auto-submit real applications without human review
- hardcode credentials in tracked files
- treat a clickable sidebar step as proof of Workday progression

Agents may:

- use local-only profile data the user explicitly provided
- use environment variables for temporary local test credentials
- stop before final submission
- record local-only artifacts in ignored paths for validation

## PDF Generation Safety

The PDF renderer is expected to stay local-first:

- self-hosted fonts are preferred
- remote render requests should be blocked during Playwright PDF generation
- generated HTML should not rely on remote scripts or tracking assets

This reduces the chance that rendering a CV leaks candidate information to third-party servers.

## Privacy Review Checklist

Before pushing changes, check:

1. no user-layer files are tracked
2. no credentials or secrets appear in tracked files
3. no local absolute paths leaked into shared system files
4. no live-test screenshots or reports with PII are being committed
5. public docs and examples use placeholders or intentionally public sample data only

## Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a privacy leak, credential exposure, tracked personal data, or another security issue:

1. do not open a public issue with the secret or personal data attached
2. remove or rotate the exposed material locally first when possible
3. prepare a minimal reproduction that does not include private data
4. report the problem privately to the maintainer if sensitive details are involved

## Scope Note

No repository can honestly promise to be "hack-proof." The practical goal here is narrower and more useful:

- minimize accidental data exposure
- keep local automation from widening the attack surface
- make privacy mistakes visible early through docs, ignore rules, and validation checks
